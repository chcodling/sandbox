        <h3>American Cornhole League</h3>
        <p>The American Cornhole League (ACL) is the worldwide governing body for professional, competitive, and
            recreational
            cornhole. The ACL provides the premier cornhole engagement experience by setting the standards for cornhole
            technology,
            media, and equipment.</p>
        <p>
            ACL Player skill levels are an important part of each and every event. Whether it’s mixing skill levels at
            an event such as in a blind draw with random partners or if it’s keeping each skill level separate at any
            event to ensure
            the most equal competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Skill levels help players reach goals and milestones as they gain more skill, experience and growth within
            their own game. The ACL encourages each player to challenge themselves to graduate to the highest level of
            competition
            at every event.

        <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
        <p>The rules for the game of Cornhole have been modified and alterated, over time, and there have been many
            adaptations of the game based on location. No matter where or how you play it, the rules are simple,
            easy-to-follow and provide the foundation for a consistent, entertaining game to take place, no matter the
            crowd.</p>

        <p>
            Court Layout
            The following dimensions and measurements serve to determine how far apart to place cornhole boards as well
            as the positioning of players during gameplay.
        </p>

        <p>
            Court Dimensions
            A cornhole court shall be a level rectangular area 10-12 feet wide and a minimum of 40-45 feet long. The
            court consists of two cornhole boards, designated pitcher's boxes, and foul lines.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pitcher's Box
            The pitcher's box is a rectangle 4 feet by 3 feet at each end of the court, parallel with, and on both sides
            of the boards. Each player must remain in the pitcher's box while pitching a cornhole bag.
        </p>

        <p>
            Foul Lines
            There are two sets of foul lines: open adult play and junior play for children 12 and under. The adult foul
            lines shall be defined as an imaginary line 27 feet between the front of each board. The junior-play foul
            lines
            shall be defined as an imaginary line 12-15 between the front of each board. Physically impaired adults or
            seniors may observe the 12-15 foot foul lines if agreed by all contestants.
